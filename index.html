            <p>If you’re looking to burn some serious fat and you’re not afraid of a little intensity, you’ve come to the right program. Super Shredded 8 (“SS8” for short) is an 8-week get-lean plan based mainly on supersets – but it’s so much more than that. If I had to sum up what Super Shredded 8 is, I would say it's a combination of my Show Time, 1-2-3 Lean and Un-Rested Development programs. That’s quite a hybrid, huh?</p>
            <p>My Super-Man program uses supersets in which exercises for opposing muscle groups are paired together. With SS8, the supersets pair exercises for the same muscle group. This is technically called a “compound set,” a term coined by the late Joe Weider over 50 years ago. But nowadays, the lifting community basically calls any pairing of two exercises with no rest in between a superset, so I’ll stick with the more modern verbiage.  </p>
